Toenail fungus occurs when fungi, typically dermatophytes, invade the nail bed. The infection thrives in warm, moist environments, making feet—especially those confined in shoes—a prime target. Factors that increase the risk of developing toenail fungus include:

Poor foot hygiene: Infrequent washing or drying of feet.

Nail trauma: Injuries that compromise the nail's integrity.

Diabetes: Elevated blood sugar levels can impair circulation and immune response.

Weakened immune system: Conditions or medications that suppress immune function.

Age: Older adults have reduced blood flow and slower nail growth, increasing susceptibility.
